# mazegame



okokokok plan time. pygame gui, literally paint software so you paint the maze.
solve button, watch it flow out in the layers, find the path. ANIMATIONS.
clear button, 'enter maze resolution' and BOOM you can draw whatever you want. zoom will suck to make.

literally just a paint software in pygame that saves to maze.png and does all the sweet animations.
