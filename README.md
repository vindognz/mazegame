# mazegame



okokokok plan time. pygame gui, literally paint software so you paint the maze.
solve button, watch it flow out in the layers, find the path. ANIMATIONS.
clear button, 'enter maze resolution' and BOOM you can draw whatever you want. zoom will suck to make.

literally just a paint software in pygame that saves to maze.png and does all the sweet animations.

i literally made all of that (but zoom cuz who needs zoom). resolution of canvas can be modified by passing in different grid_size to the class. (to make the window not giant, change cell_size accordingly)

controls:

q = start tile
e = end tile
c = clear
g = run BFS
h = run A*
left click to draw walls
right click to erase walls
esc to cancel animations
